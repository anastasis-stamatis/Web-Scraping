# Web Scraping
Indicative examples of web scraping. Basic scraping undertaken with BeautifulSoup and more advanced cases with Selenium.

All scraping presented here is used within a limited, non-scalable context, for indicative and educational purposes only.
It consists of the following projects:

## Search results
Getting the first few search results for a given topic.

## Health & Safety Datasets
Get a list of specific datasets from https://grid3.gov.ng/datasets, for a data-for-good project.
For this project, I had to find a way to interact with the page, scroll up/down to find the buttons I needed to click.

## Automatic mass mail creation
I wanted to automate the sending of mass mails.
Sicne there is a max. number of recepients per email, I developed this tool to automatically creating copies of drafts and add the recipients as bcc.

## Restaurant Scraper
Scraping publicly available restaurant emails to get contact details. URLs have been changed for anonymity purposes.

## Backend Website Data
A website of ours provided export which did not include all the data of interest. As our developer had a huge backlog to complete, I decided to scrape the backend to get us the data we needed.
